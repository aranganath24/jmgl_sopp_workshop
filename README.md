## Readme

This repository contains the materials required to generate the Bookdown version of the introductory GIS workshop entitled "Exploring the Geography of Systemic Racism with Spatial Data Science". This workshop is the basis for a forthcoming article in the [Journal of Map and Geography Libraries](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wmgl20/current) (citation information will be provided upon publication).

For the purpose of long-term preservation, the workshop lesson plan has also been deposited (in PDF format) in [CU Scholar](https://scholar.colorado.edu/) (the institutional repository of the University of Colorado Boulder). You can access that version of the workshop at the following link: [https://doi.org/10.25810/x6yz-6g18](https://doi.org/10.25810/x6yz-6g18). 

I am providing this alternative Bookdown version of the workshop (in addition to the version on CU Scholar), since it may be more intuitive and user-friendly for teaching and learning purposes. In addition, the repository materials provided here can be used to reproduce the workshop, or adapt it to different empirical contexts, as required. To explore these materials in more detail, simply fork this repository to your own GitHub account. You can also view the Bookdown version of the workshop directly online, by clicking on the following link: [https://aranganath24.github.io/jmgl_sopp_workshop/](https://aranganath24.github.io/jmgl_sopp_workshop/). 

If you notice any errors, or would like to make suggestions, please consider submitting a pull request. The workshop lesson plan posted to CU Scholar will not change, but my hope is that this version can serve as a dynamic resource for the geospatial librarian and educator community. 

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*
